# MMOS Configure 

I wrote the Configure program in 2019, previously with my client setup and configuration was done manually. Later this upgraded were performed to streamline this process, so became more complex.

The basic concept of the program is to copy files into a server folder, create a settings file and reattach linked tables.

The configuration program can also be used to create development specific settings files.
